CS271 Compiler I
-------------------------------

NOTES:  
*In main Compiler_I.java you will see my manual tests, commented out.
 
*Also, I took one of the example files in project and
demonstrated both tokenized and parser to make your life easier.

[Post-Assignment Self-criticism & Notes:
*I am proud of my tokenizer honestly.

*But if i would design parser in more depth at the beginning,
thing could be way easier and more efficient for me. It is still
good but you may see a little redundancy here and there.
For instance: I could for example pass the white space indents in as string parameter.
That way could manipulate them way easier. But oh well .. It
was too late when i realize couple things in code. ]
